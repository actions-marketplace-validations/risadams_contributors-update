# Contributors Update

This is a custom GitHub action that updates the contributors list. It is intended to be run on a regular basis, and to serve as test playground for learning how to write and maintain custom GitHub actions.

## Install

This action is written in JavaScript and can be configured by adding an action to your project's `actions.yml` file.
You will need to update the `repo` argument with the repository you wish to update.  **this will only work on public repositories**

If the `exclude_bots` flag is disabled, you may see a large number of bots in the output.  There still may be some bots in the output if they are internally classified as users in the github API call.

```yaml
name: Update Contributors
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: "0 0 1 * *"
  workflow_dispatch:
jobs:
  main:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: risadams/contributors-update@v2
        with:
          repo: risadams/risadams.com
          exclude_bots: true
```

The file contents will be written to an output variable called `contrib`. Which can be piped to other actions as needed.

## Support
